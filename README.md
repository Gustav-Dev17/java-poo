### About Java

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

### Opening Java projects
<br>
Step 1: Download Eclipse IDE at <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">eclipse.org</a> (<em>please, avoid using other IDEs to open these projects because they were all created with Eclipse</em>).

<br><br>
Step 2:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. In Eclipse, open the ClearTeam Explorer perspective. Click File > Import.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. On the Select page of the Import dialog box, select Existing Projects into Workspace in the Select an import source list box and click Next.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. On the Import Projects page of the Import dialog box, verify that the Select root directory option is selected and then click the Browse button for this option.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. In the Browse for Folder dialog box, navigate to the view storage location of the user_name_ccrctut_proj development view and expand the user_name_ccrctut_pvob VOB.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Select the CCRC_UCM_Tutorial folder and click OK. The CCRC_UCM_Tutorial project appears in the Projects list box in the Import Projects dialog box.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Click Finish.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Click Window > Open Perspective > Other > Java and the CCRC_UCM_Tutorial Eclipse project appears in the ClearTeam Navigator view. If you do not see the ClearTeam Navigator, click Window > Show View > Navigator.
